# üéì MHT-CET College Predictor

A Machine Learning project to help students predict eligible engineering colleges based on their MHT-CET rank, category, gender, and seat type. It uses real historical admission cutoff data from MHT-CET centralized counselling (CAP rounds).


## üìä About the Dataset

The dataset includes cutoff ranks from previous years‚Äô MHT-CET CAP rounds, published by DTE Maharashtra.

### Dataset Features:
- year: Admission year (2016‚Äì2021)
- institute_type: Government, Private, Autonomous
- institute_short: Short name (e.g., VJTI, COEP)
- program_name: Engineering branch (e.g., Computer Engineering)
- degree_short: Degree type (e.g., B.E., B.Tech)
- category: Reservation category (OPEN, OBC, SC, ST, etc.)
- seat_type: Quota type (HU, OHU, Minority)
- gender: Gender-based allocation
- opening_rank: First admitted rank
- closing_rank`: Last admitted rank

üìÅ Source: Official data from DTE Maharashtra CAP round reports.
